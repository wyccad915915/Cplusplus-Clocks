# Cplusplus-Clocks

The Clocks C++ Program starts at 12am/00:00 and prompts the user to increment time. The program updates the clock and displays the new time in both 12-hour and 24-hour formats. The user has the option to add 1 hour, 1 minute, or 1 second to the time. The program also includes a menu for the user to choose what action they would like to take.

# What was done well

The program accurately displays the time in both 12-hour and 24-hour formats. The user has the option to increment the time by 1 hour, 1 minute, or 1 second, and the program accurately updates the time. The program includes a menu for the user to choose what action they would like to take.

# Areas for Improvement

The program could be improved by adding the option for the user to set the time manually. The program could also be improved by adding validation to the input to ensure that only valid values are entered.

# Transferable and Adaptable skills

This program uses 1 class, as well as methods/functions that could potentially be used in other programs. New methods could be introduced to set the time manually.
